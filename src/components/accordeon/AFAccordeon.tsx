            The accordion component delivers large amounts of content in a small
            space through progressive disclosure. The user gets key details
            about the underlying content and can choose to expand that content
            within the constraints of the accordion. Accordions work especially
            well on mobile interfaces or whenever vertical space is at a
            premium.
